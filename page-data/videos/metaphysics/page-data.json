In 2014, he was warned while deciphering his own BaZi, of an impending crisis that will affect his career in 2015. This turned out to be that his company was being merged with another. Intrigued by the result, he took a full course on BaZi in 2015 to prepare himself for any further downturn and to protect his income. That was the best decision he has ever made in terms of personal education.\n\nHe has launched himself into the training and speaking arena, eloquently discoursed on topics as diverse as the ﬁeld of Metaphysics, Property investments and Share Investments. He has been invited to major events such as the iProperty Expo and Popular Bookfest to share his experience and expertise on the above-mentioned subjects. Kevin has also graced the airwaves of MelodyFM on their signature section Morning BOSS to spread the beneﬁts of applying Metaphysics into modern settings.\n\n#JoeyYap \n#KevinChan \n#MonthlyForecast","videoId":"sQ6Bw4E5tMA","publishedAt":"2020-10-12T05:38:04Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"Joey Yap","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sQ6Bw4E5tMA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"ee526a35-ce72-5d70-aec0-0f5573150cbb","title":"How to become the person you’re meant to be...","description":"How to become the person you’re meant to be...\nHere’s my answer: The day we take responsibility for our emotions, energy and time, is the day we become who we were meant to be.

There is a great difference between colour psychology and colour symbolism. Historically, what is often described as colour psychology is actually colour symbolism – the conscious associations that we are conditioned to make. Cultural responses to colour derive from a variety of causes: for example, green is the sacred colour throughout Islam, being the colour of the Prophet’s robe; in Ireland it is considered lucky, perhaps because when the world around us contains plenty of green this indicates the presence of water and therefore little danger of famine; in England it is considered unlucky, possibly because of its association with decay and disease. During the talk you’ll learn about colour and the energies behind it and its profound effect on human behaviour and why colour is the most influential element in the design mix and therefore in feng shui.\n\nWatch the feng shui conference on one page here\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/the-9th-feng-shui-society-conference-9-10-may-2015-london-uk/","videoId":"rr2j7Z5Q3hQ","publishedAt":"2015-07-06T12:55:09Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rr2j7Z5Q3hQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"1f6d2d6d-24e6-5d18-93c6-f59f81179aa6","title":"Your Main Door – Diane Grobler / 8 Feng Shui Conference London UK","description":"Your Main Door – it’s Connection between Internal and External Energies (Qi) – Diane Grobler (South Africa)\n8 Feng Shui Conference London UK 17-18 May 2014\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/\n\nThis is a largely visual presentation on landform feng shui and its influence on homes, apartments and businesses.

An astrocartography map of the world will show you exactly where each planet was passing over at the moment of your birth and how different locations may have different influences, making it easier or more difficult to manifest your goals and even to resolve personality and health issues. If you’re considering a move to a new location, or want to have more insights into how the current location is shaping your life, astrocartography has the answers.\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/","videoId":"2RBUO31mhiI","publishedAt":"2014-08-28T12:37:32Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2RBUO31mhiI/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"1016b8a3-e384-5b4b-9e86-1aaacecc93ae","title":"Introduction by The Chairman / 8 Feng Shui Conference London UK 17-18 May 2014","description":"Introduction to the 8th Feng Shui Society Conference by the Chairman Raymond Catchpole\n8 Feng Shui Conference London UK 17-18 May 2014\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/","videoId":"uLYz7Gcxq-s","publishedAt":"2014-08-17T09:34:43Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLYz7Gcxq-s/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"c1eba17f-29fb-5c19-85b3-f50d123bc8ff","title":"Feng Shui Form & Architecture in China – Jodi Brunner / 8 Feng Shui Conference London UK","description":"Feng Shui Form & Architecture in China – Jodi Brunner (Australia)\n8 Feng Shui Conference London UK 17-18 May 2014\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/\n\nFeng Shui Form & Architecture in China – Jodi Brunner (Australia)\nAustralians love to travel and in order for us to truly understand the roots of this extraordinary art known as feng shui, at some point in our training it is important to actually travel to China ourselves. Doing so allows us to feel the qi of the place, to visualise the locations where our predecessors have planned their feng shui, and to ponder their techniques and choices. This enriches our knowledge of yin and yang feng shui, form school and Chinese architecture and symbolism. If you have not had the opportunity to travel to China, share with our speaker the wonders of feng shui in its homeland. If you have been to China, Jodi’s presentation will bring back fond memories. Travel with Jodi and her Luo Pan from Xian to Shanghai, Hong Kong to Hangzhou, on a visual tour to places of feng shui significance.\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/","videoId":"7MOdjHxmue4","publishedAt":"2014-08-17T09:43:40Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7MOdjHxmue4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"741d8cad-0184-5954-a7d7-d54a8aea8f5d","title":"Getting lost on your goal direction?
