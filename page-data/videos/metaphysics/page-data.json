The majority of people think this is a talent that you are born with. Yet, it is one of the most prized skills that you’ll see in any resumes or CVs – “I’m A Fast Learner” they will all say.\n\nThey say knowledge is power, and I couldn’t agree more. Love, money, health and career come and go, but knowledge is something that can never be taken away from you. Once you acquire knowledge, it’s with you for life. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is one of the most important aspirations anyone can have.\n\nHowever, learning any subject does come with its challenges.\n\nMaybe you feel like you’re a slow learner. Maybe there are one or two concepts that are beyond your grasp. Maybe you’re experiencing an information overload and you’re left dazed and confused. If any of these things apply to you, not to worry because I have just the solution.\n\nIn today’s video, I’ll be showing you 5 tips that you can immediately apply for you to learn more effectively. In fact, it’s the same techniques that I personally use for myself throughout my two decades in the field of Chinese Metaphysics.\n\nKnowledge is the best type of investment you can do for yourself.

Betrayal, disappointment, hurt… these things are unavoidable.

What matters is not how others have treated you, but how you treat yourself.

Whether it’s to achieve your dreams, putting food on the table or sending kids to school, at some point money is definitely involved. It may not be the most important aspect of your life, but it still plays a vital role.\n\nSome people have a negative attitude towards wealth. They feel that money is the root of all evil; Rich people are greedy, rich people are unkind, rich people don’t have time for their family… if you have that sort of perception, you will never be rich yourself.\n\n This is because your inner self will never allow it to happen.\n\nHow you define wealth can either attract it into your life or create an invisible barrier that blocks it away.

Frodo has Gandalf. Neo has Morpheus. It seems that having a mentor is crucial to any success story… but is it really true?\n\nI believe that the concept of mentors are overrated - here's why? Find out more in my live better series videos.\n\nLife doesn’t always play the way it does in the movies. In reality, there’s no such person who is just waiting for you to appear and impart his or her secrets. In fact, I would even say that it takes a lot of commitment to form a relationship with a mentor.\n\nPeople seem to have this misconception that the “Noble People” they see in their BaZi chart would be a mentor that would teach them everything and solve all their problems. In truth, the Noble People are simply individuals who are instrumental in your growth… which mean they can even be nasty towards you.\n\nIf your whole life is just desperately looking for someone to answer all your questions, you will never truly succeed. If you want success, you have to be independent with or without the “Noble People”. In this video, I’ll shed some light on this entire concept and how you can truly benefit from it.\n\nDon’t wait for things to happen.

For some, it can even be as simple as having good health. Whatever it is, the definition of a good life is when you have harmony. \n\nAccording to classical texts, harmony happens when your elements are balanced. As I’ve mentioned previously, these elements and energies are not literal. They are the metaphorical representation of your thoughts, emotion and mindset. When they are balanced, a good life can be achieved.\n\nNow, I know what you’re thinking. “What if my chart isn’t balanced?”\n\nIf you think your chart is bad, believe me, I’ve seen worse. Despite of that, by identifying the opportunities and strength they possess, even these people can and have obtained happiness in their lives. A good life is possible for such charts and I’ll show you how in this video.\n\nRemember, it’s not your astrology chart that determines the quality of your life. It is the choices you make and the actions you take that shape your destiny.\n\nWhat is the good life to you?

Rinse and repeat. In this mundane routine, it wouldn’t be a surprise if you wonder at some point if you are truly happy and satisfied with your life. Is there any meaning to it all?\n\nIn our search for purpose and inner peace, people tend to look for the answer in all the wrong places. They buy things they don’t need, try to impress people they don’t like and convince everyone that they’re doing great. Evidently, none of these things would bring them happiness and thus this negative feeling amplifies.\n\nTo achieve inner peace, you must have balance.\n\nIn Chinese Metaphysics, this is achieved by balancing the Five Elements. Despite its name, the elements themselves aren’t literal. They are merely different forms of energy within us that exists as our thoughts, emotions, spiritual and physical being. When you are able to balance these factors together, true happiness can be achieved.\n\nIf you want to know how to control your emotions, reprogram your mind and find happiness through all the noises, watch the video until the end. You don’t need anyone or anything to find tranquility. It is and has always been within your grasp.\n\nWhat is true happiness and inner peace to you?

We have our routines, what is normal to us and the things we usually expect. When something comes along and disrupts what we are already comfortable with, it gets painful.\n\nFrom the perspective of astrology, this is known as a “Clash”. It is when the energy that’s coming into your life is in direct opposite of your own and change occurs as a result. To a lot of people, BaZi practitioners especially, it’s not something they look forward to. \n\nAgain, repeat after me… Change is good.\n\nThe advantage of knowing metaphysics is that we are able to anticipate these changes in advance. When you know it’s coming your way, you can decide on your own terms how the change should happen. You can even initiate the change itself and be in control. I’ll be explaining how you can do so in this video. \n\nRemember the last time you tried something new? How about meeting a new person? These things are also a form of clash; changes that happen in your life. They can be happy and exciting experiences. Always remember that changing for the better is always a possibility.

It’s true in a sense that holding on to hatred and anger only hurts one person… yourself. \n\nIn Chinese Metaphysics, everything is energy. Energy naturally attracts one another. If you are resentful, that is what you will attract and manifest into your life. It won’t disappear if it’s constantly on your mind. So, how do you let go of resentment? How can we achieve true forgiveness and release our emotional baggage? \n\nThere are several ways on how you can overcome resentment using Chinese Metaphysics and I’ll be sharing with you some of them in this video. I believe that this is an important step in transforming your life for the better. \n\nIf you can’t let go of the past, you can’t head towards a brighter future. You have much more to gain than to suffer silently. If you have any resentment with you right now, don’t you think it’s about time you let go and move on? If you’re waiting for a sign to do so, this is it.\n\nForgive others and more importantly, forgive yourself.

People in general are always curious whether they’re destined for greatness or if they’re fated to have a terrible life. Let me ask you this question.\n\nIf anyone tells you either of these answers, what would you do about it?\n\nThis is a very mundane way to use astrology and it can’t really help transform your life for the better. In one of my previous videos, I’ve spoken about the difference between fate and destiny. Fate is when opportunities present itself and destiny is what you make of it.\n\nI do not subscribe to the fact that anyone’s destiny is fixed. It is about being able to transform and change the life to the way that you want it. The whole idea of astrology is to learn to be in control, NOT to be controlled by destiny. If you want to learn how to design your destiny, then it starts with you taking charge and responsibility over your own life.\n\nSo what’s the best way to predict the future? It is by creating it yourself.\n\nWhat sort of future would you like to create?

When you couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, you give up and become miserable. \n\nIn this negative state, it’s easy to be susceptible to negative influences like fear and doubt.

In the real world, your passion may not be what the market demands or what your career requires. You can’t do what you love and expect others to pay for it.\n\nA lot of people think that BaZi astrology can simply tell them what the perfect job is for them or what is “suitable” for them. There is no such thing. Achieving success in your career or business won’t happen if you are not willing to do what it takes. Not everything is going to fit into what you want and be according to what you like.\n\nIf you want to achieve success, you have to be great at what you do.\n\nYour astrology chart may point you towards your suitable field or industry, but it won’t be ideal if you suck at the job. In order to make things easier, you have to get better. In order to get anything you want, there is a price to be paid. This is the principle of cause and effect.

But one thing we can all agree on is that Happiness is a feeling that comes from within. \n\nI believe, that no one can be happy all the time. But it’s also true that no one can be unhappy all the time. What makes us human is that we are able to experience both happiness and unhappiness within the same period of time.

Without one, you cannot have the other. \n \nWhat we’ve been taught or passed down about happiness is a lie. \n\nIn this video, I’ve broken it down to 5 parts.

In fact, this is far from the truth. \n\nThis (procrastination) could happen to any of us.

In 2014, he was warned while deciphering his own BaZi, of an impending crisis that will affect his career in 2015. This turned out to be that his company was being merged with another. Intrigued by the result, he took a full course on BaZi in 2015 to prepare himself for any further downturn and to protect his income. That was the best decision he has ever made in terms of personal education.\n\nHe has launched himself into the training and speaking arena, eloquently discoursed on topics as diverse as the ﬁeld of Metaphysics, Property investments and Share Investments. He has been invited to major events such as the iProperty Expo and Popular Bookfest to share his experience and expertise on the above-mentioned subjects.

In 2014, he was warned while deciphering his own BaZi, of an impending crisis that will affect his career in 2015. This turned out to be that his company was being merged with another. Intrigued by the result, he took a full course on BaZi in 2015 to prepare himself for any further downturn and to protect his income. That was the best decision he has ever made in terms of personal education.\n\nHe has launched himself into the training and speaking arena, eloquently discoursed on topics as diverse as the ﬁeld of Metaphysics, Property investments and Share Investments. He has been invited to major events such as the iProperty Expo and Popular Bookfest to share his experience and expertise on the above-mentioned subjects. Kevin has also graced the airwaves of MelodyFM on their signature section Morning BOSS to spread the beneﬁts of applying Metaphysics into modern settings.\n\n#JoeyYap \n#KevinChan \n#MonthlyForecast","videoId":"ehlNCvk1IME","publishedAt":"2020-08-11T07:25:45Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"Joey Yap","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ehlNCvk1IME/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"edf84360-20c2-54f4-96e9-92e010c4110d","title":"What You Can Do When You Get Hurt","description":"Everybody gets hurt.

The same principles can also be easily applied when we look for the ideal placement and directions in existing living spaces.\n\nWatch the feng shui conference on one page here\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/the-9th-feng-shui-society-conference-9-10-may-2015-london-uk/","videoId":"TQ7_nw9sQsU","publishedAt":"2015-07-03T15:19:53Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TQ7_nw9sQsU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"f608c851-4cb1-5969-8731-c64d4e3d1668","title":"Pactical Feng Shui Tips from Japanese, Korean and Chinese Gardens – Victor H.

Gary Grant will present an ecological approach to urban greening, where nature is brought into our towns and cities in order to increase wellbeing, reduce air and noise pollution, lower temperatures in heat waves and reduce flood risk. He will describe a number of initiatives, including green roofs, living walls and rain gardens in London and inner city locations elsewhere in the world. These systems can be functionally incorporated into urban feng shui projects.\n\nWatch the feng shui conference on one page here\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/the-9th-feng-shui-society-conference-9-10-may-2015-london-uk/","videoId":"YNaG8MmCGJU","publishedAt":"2015-07-03T13:36:05Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YNaG8MmCGJU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"a7c5fee8-1587-5628-a5da-02c056431f83","title":"The Three Lucks: Heaven, Human, Earth – Laurent Langlais (UK) - 9 FSS Conference 2015 London, UK","description":"The Three Lucks: Heaven, Human, Earth (The Taoist View on Feng Shui and Life) – Laurent Langlais (UK) \nThe 9th Feng Shui Society Conference 9-10 May 2015 London, UK\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/the-9th-feng-shui-society-conference-9-10-may-2015-london-uk/\n\nFeng shui is part of a greater system of  Taoism.

There is a great difference between colour psychology and colour symbolism. Historically, what is often described as colour psychology is actually colour symbolism – the conscious associations that we are conditioned to make. Cultural responses to colour derive from a variety of causes: for example, green is the sacred colour throughout Islam, being the colour of the Prophet’s robe; in Ireland it is considered lucky, perhaps because when the world around us contains plenty of green this indicates the presence of water and therefore little danger of famine; in England it is considered unlucky, possibly because of its association with decay and disease. During the talk you’ll learn about colour and the energies behind it and its profound effect on human behaviour and why colour is the most influential element in the design mix and therefore in feng shui.\n\nWatch the feng shui conference on one page here\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/the-9th-feng-shui-society-conference-9-10-may-2015-london-uk/","videoId":"rr2j7Z5Q3hQ","publishedAt":"2015-07-06T12:55:09Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"The Feng Shui Society","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rr2j7Z5Q3hQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"1f6d2d6d-24e6-5d18-93c6-f59f81179aa6","title":"Your Main Door – Diane Grobler / 8 Feng Shui Conference London UK","description":"Your Main Door – it’s Connection between Internal and External Energies (Qi) – Diane Grobler (South Africa)\n8 Feng Shui Conference London UK 17-18 May 2014\n\nhttp://www.fengshuisociety.org.uk/8-feng-shui-society-conference-17-18-may-2014-london-uk/\n\nThis is a largely visual presentation on landform feng shui and its influence on homes, apartments and businesses.

Doing so allows us to feel the qi of the place, to visualise the locations where our predecessors have planned their feng shui, and to ponder their techniques and choices. This enriches our knowledge of yin and yang feng shui, form school and Chinese architecture and symbolism. If you have not had the opportunity to travel to China, share with our speaker the wonders of feng shui in its homeland. If you have been to China, Jodi’s presentation will bring back fond memories.
